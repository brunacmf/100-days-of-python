# TODO 1. Prompt user by asking “What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):”
# a. Check the user’s input to decide what to do next.
# b. The prompt should show every time action has completed, e.g. once the drink is
# dispensed. The prompt should show again to serve the next customer.

# Done on TODO8

# TODO 2. Turn off the Coffee Machine by entering “off” to the prompt.
# a. For maintainers of the coffee machine, they can use “off” as the secret word to turn off
# the machine. Your code should end execution when this happens.

# Done on TODO8

# TODO 3. Print report.
# a. When the user enters “report” to the prompt, a report should be generated that shows
# the current resource values. e.g.
# Water: 100ml
# Milk: 50ml
# Coffee: 76g
# Money: $2.5

# Done on TODO8

# TODO 4. Check resources sufficient?
# a. When the user chooses a drink, the program should check if there are enough
# resources to make that drink.
# b. E.g. if Latte requires 200ml water but there is only 100ml left in the machine. It should
# not continue to make the drink but print: “Sorry there is not enough water.”
# c. The same should happen if another resource is depleted, e.g. milk or coffee.

# a. If there are sufficient resources to make the drink selected, then the program should
# prompt the user to insert coins.
# b. Remember that quarters = $0.25, dimes = $0.10, nickles = $0.05, pennies = $0.01
# c. Calculate the monetary value of the coins inserted. E.g. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 2
# pennies = 0.25 + 0.1 x 2 + 0.05 + 0.01 x 2 = $0.52

# TODO 6. Check transaction successful?
# a. Check that the user has inserted enough money to purchase the drink they selected.
# e.g. Latte cost $2.50, but they only inserted $0.52 then after counting the coins the
# program should say “Sorry that's not enough money. Money refunded.”.
# b. But if the user has inserted enough money, then the cost of the drink gets added to the
# machine as the profit and this will be reflected the next time “report” is triggered. E.g.
# Water: 100ml
# Milk: 50ml
# Coffee: 76g
# Money: $2.5
# c. If the user has inserted too much money, the machine should offer change.
# E.g. “Here is $2.45 dollars in change.” The change should be rounded to 2 decimal
# places.

# TODO 7. Make Coffee.
# a. If the transaction is successful and there are enough resources to make the drink the
# user selected, then the ingredients to make the drink should be deducted from the
# coffee machine resources.
# E.g. report before purchasing latte:
# Water: 300ml
# Milk: 200ml
# Coffee: 100g
# Money: $0
# Report after purchasing latte:
# Water: 100ml
# Milk: 50ml
# Coffee: 76g
# Money: $2.5
# b. Once all resources have been deducted, tell the user “Here is your latte. Enjoy!”. If
# latte was their choice of drink.
